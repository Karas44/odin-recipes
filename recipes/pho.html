  <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Pho is a broth based soup dish traditionally from Vietnam. While pho is typically made with 
   some form of protein, today we will be creating a vegetarian pho. This is actually quite 
   a bit easier, as pho tends to be a customizable assortment of vegetables inside a broth, 
   with a choice(s) of protein added in. Let's begin.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>2 scoops Pho base</li>
    <li>1 oz Rice noodles</li>
    <li>6 cups water</li>
    <li>4 oz bean sprouts</li>
    <li>1 oz basil</li>
    <li>1 oz cilantro</li>
    <li>1 oz mint</li>
    <li>2 slices jalapeno</li>
    <li>2 oz soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 oz hoisin sauce</li>
    <li>0.5 oz green onion</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>Pour water into a pot and heat to boil. Set pho base near water and portion rice noodles into a bowl (noodles will shrink greatly after cooking).</li>
     <li>Prepare vegetables on seperate platter. Don't be worried if amounts aren't exact; pho is exactly what you want it to be.</li>
     <li>Once water is boiling, toss noodles in til tender. For pre-prepared noodles, this is 10-15secs. For non-prepared noodles, this will be 2-3min. Strain.</li>
     <li>Return noodles to bowl after straining. Add base to boiling water. Stir, and reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
     <li>Add your choice of vegetables on top of noodles. Ladle broth over, then add sauces. Garnish with green onion.</li>
     <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
