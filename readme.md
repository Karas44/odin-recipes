<!-- This is a description of the odin-recipes repository. This may include a list of different
skills used, thoughts as I tackled the project, and/or feelings once complete. 

Before I begin, I want to put forth that at this point of my progress into TOP, I am fervently
enjoying this. It is very satisfying learning new and interesting things, especially related
to computers, which I and my friends have been surrounded by our entire lives. It is very 
fulfilling to become better at using computers; a skill which I definitely felt lacking. We will
see how this project goes, but every preceding one has felt great. -->
