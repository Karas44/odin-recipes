This is a description of the odin-recipes repository. This may include a list of different
skills used, thoughts as I tackled the project, and/or feelings once complete. 

Before I begin, I want to put forth that at this point of my progress into TOP, I am fervently
enjoying this. It is very satisfying learning new and interesting things, especially related
to computers, which I and my friends have been surrounded by our entire lives. It is very 
fulfilling to become better at using computers; a skill which I definitely felt lacking. We will
see how this project goes, but every preceding one has felt great.

Upon completion edit: I need to learn how to spell olive oil and not oilive oil. Overall, it felt good.
Using lists is going well, and I'm becoming accustomed to attribute and image tagging. Starting to
commit to the idea of keeping code clean and short if at all possible. Also need to become more used to
git and github commits, but that will come with time. Ready next!
